	    	<h2>About me</h2>
	    	<p> Hello my name is Iris licorn Vink. I was born in the Netherlands and I am studying Communication and Multimedia design in the lovely city The Hague. <br> <br>

 Before I did this study I published a book and a magazine without knowledge about design. I love to write, design, see art, do make-up and fashion. It is my way of expressing  myself. Besides that I really want to help people because it didn't take much or I would never write this. <br> <br>

This helps me, I really love this and I really want to make people see differently because of my creations. Give them a feeling and something to think about. That is why I have an eye on my home page, it is a metaphor : "let them see differently." The things that I have been through and my purpose divides me from other designers. 

Besides that I am an go-getter. I am a creative creator and I want to take a project to the next level. Studying and listening to people is one of the most important steps in creating a unique experience of the user. My core values are: Love, positivity, surreal and creativity. I want to put these values in everything I do to make the best product for the user and client.  <br>
